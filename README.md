# RNA-Nussinov
Project of Algoritmi e Strutture Dati. To realize in Java an implementation of Nussinov's algorithm that, given a sequence of nucleotides, finds a pseudonode-free RNA secondary structure with a maximum number of weak bonds. The problem is to be solved using the dynamic programming technique.
