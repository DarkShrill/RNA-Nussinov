Hi! I'm Edoardo and i'm a student of Sapienza University and a worker. This repository was made into my free time for have fun. 

### Let's start 
Project of Algoritmi e Strutture Dati. To realize in Java an implementation of Nussinov's algorithm that, given a sequence of nucleotides, finds a pseudonode-free RNA secondary structure with a maximum number of weak bonds. The problem is to be solved using the dynamic programming technique.

# Project Goals:
* Realize in Java an implementation of Nussinov's algorithm that, given a sequence of nucleotides, finds a pseudonode-free RNA secondary structure with a maximum number of weak bonds. The problem is to be solved using the dynamic programming technique.
* Build a JUnit 4 test suite that checks the implemented functionality.
* Evaluate numerically the performance of the implemented algorithm.
* Write a report on the project and make an oral presentation of it using slides and the written code.
